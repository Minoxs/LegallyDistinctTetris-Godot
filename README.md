# LegallyDistinctTetris - Godot

I've been giving Godot a go here and there, but nothing ever came out of it.
This is, technically, the only working game (in a loose definition of game) I got out of it.

Tried out some stuff without ever actually watching any Godot tutorials, only based on the docs, so it's VERY messy.
One of my main goals here was to check out how the C# stuff works, and how it integrates with GDScript (works, but not great).
At least, going 100% C# seems to be a very viable option. 

Please ignore all the dodgy code, this was done in just a couple of hours :)

Maybe I'll watch some Godot tutorials and rework this and _actually_ use Godot's features, maybe I won't.
